## This notebook outlines the task of performing Big Data Analysis to demonstrate the ability to handle and process large-scale datasets efficiently. The primary objective is to use scalable tools like PySpark or Dask. The notebook structure includes steps for importing necessary libraries, setting up the big data environment (like initializing a Spark Session), loading a conceptual large dataset (your_big_dataset.csv), and performing common analysis steps. Key analytical steps involve Data Cleaning & Preprocessing and Group Analysis & Statistics (e.g., counting categories). The final deliverable is expected to be summarized findings from these analyses, coupled with performance metrics to validate the scalability of the chosen tool.
